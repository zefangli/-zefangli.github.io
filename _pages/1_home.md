#### Bio

I am an incoming PhD student at Johns Hopkins University Department of Civil and Systems Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Jochen Mueller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yCnfRi4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My master's degree in Mechanical Engineering was obtained from Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked under [Dr. Carmel Majidi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1LyndUsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Gina Olson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ybRBfeMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [Soft Machines Lab](http://sml.me.cmu.edu/), developing liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators for soft robotics and human-computer interaction.

I obtained bachelor's degree from [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) (UM-SJTU JI) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), with major in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Computer Science. My undergraduate research was on elastic mechanics, structural health monitoring, and robotics.
